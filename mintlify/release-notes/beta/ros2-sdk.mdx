title: ROS2 SDK for Go2 Beta Release
description: "v1.0.0-beta.2"
---

## What's included

Beta release for the Docker image openmindagi/unitree_go2_sdk, which provides the full ROS2 system for running the Unitree Go2 SDK.

## Features

### v1.0.0-beta.2
- Added CRSF Protocol Support
- Added turbo mode for the xbox controller
- Added listening and scouting configuration to zenoh_bridge_config for disabling multicast to prevent receiving messages from other robots
- Introduced Pydantic models for location and pose data
- New endpoints to add and list map locations, and ensure locations are stored in a dedicated directory. 
- docker-compose is updated to mount a new 'locations' volume. Also extended the orchestrator API to handle 'add_location' and 'list_locations' actions.
- Added MediaMTX watcher: MediaMTX is a zero-dependency media server and proxy used to publish, read, proxy, record, and playback live video and audio streams. It serves as a central "media router," handling multiple streaming protocols like RTSP, WebRTC, RTMP, and HLS. 

### v1.0.0-beta.1
- Real-time SLAM: Simultaneous localization and mapping using SLAM Toolbox
- RPLiDAR Integration: Support for RPLiDAR A1/A2/A3 series sensors
- Navigation: Integration with Nav2 for autonomous navigation
- Robot Control: Direct integration with Unitree Go2 movement commands
- Visualization: Pre-configured RViz setup for monitoring
- Transform Management: Automatic handling of coordinate frame transforms

## Component Overview

### Watchdog

- Monitors ROS2 topics and sensor health.
- Automatically restarts `om1_sensor` if any topics or sensors stop publishing data.
- Ensures system stability during long-running sessions.

### om1_sensor

- Manages all low-level sensor drivers:
  - Intel RealSense D435 (depth camera)
  - RPLidar (LiDAR scanning)
- Publishes ROS2 topics for system consumption:
  - `/om/paths` — Processed path and localization data
  - `/scan` — Raw LiDAR scan data

### Orchestrator

- Provides API endpoints and cloud service integration.
- Manages:
  - SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
  - Navigation (Nav2)
  - Map storage and loading
- Allows interaction via REST APIs.
