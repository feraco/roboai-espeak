## Requirements

### Hardware

- A laptop/PC
- A mobile phone
- UbTech Yanshee (mini humanoid robot)

### Software

- Yanshee mobile app
- OM1
- [OM1 API key](https://portal.openmind.org/)

### Installation

First, install the Yanshee mobile app on your phone. This will allow you to retrieve robot's IP address. Then, install OM1 on your laptop or PC, following the [standard instructions](../developing/1_get-started).

### Connecting to the Robot

- Switch on your Bluetooth and location.
- Go to the Yanshee mobile application and click on the icon on the top right corner. 
- Check the serial number at the back of your robot and connect to the same robot. 
- Make sure you are connected to the same network as your system is connected to.
- Once the connection has been set up, check to make sure you are able to execute the functionalities available on the application.

### Retrieve the Robot's IP Address

Option 1- Open the menu on the top left corner of the application. Go to Setup -> Robot information. Note down the IP address for future reference.

Option 2- You'll need:

- HDMI cable
- External monitor
- USB mouse
- USB keyboard

Setup Steps:

- Connect the HDMI cable to the robot's HDMI port.
- Plug the mouse and keyboard into the USB ports on the right side of the robot's chest.
- Ensure the robot's Raspberry Pi is on the same network as your computer.

To find the IP address:

- Open the terminal.
- Run:
```bash
ifconfig
```
The IP address will be listed under the `inet` field.

### Steps   

Set the OM1 API key and robot IP address in the config file (`config/ubtech_yanshee.json5`).

```bash
    "api_key": "om1_live_..."
    "robot_ip": "<your robot's ip address>"
```

Then, run the the agent using `uv run src/run.py ubtech_yanshee`. You will now be able to make the robot take actions like walk forward, walk backward, do a push up, give you a hug, turn right, turn left, bow, crouch and more via voice commands. You can also have a conversation with it and ask about its surroundings.
