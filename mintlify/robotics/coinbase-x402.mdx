## Overview

[x402](https://www.x402.org/) is an open protocol for internet-native payments. It is a simple, secure, and interoperable protocol that allows users to send and receive payments from anywhere in the world.

## Integration

OM1 has a built-in x402 input and action modules. You can give your robot full economic autonomy by adding x402 input and action modules to its `.config` file.

So the robot knows its wallet balance, add the `X402Input`:

```
  "agent_inputs": [
    {
      "type": "X402Input"
    },
  ]
```

So that the robot can autonomously buy things it wants, such as electricity, transportation (e.g. Waymo rides) and compute, add the `x402_command`:	

```
  "agent_actions": [
    {
      "name": "x402_command",
      "llm_label": "Your payment wallet, which allows you to pay for things you would like to buy",	
      "implementation": "passthrough",
      "connector": "x402"
    }
  ]
```

**CAUTION**: Suitably configured system prompts will result in autonomous (and inherently unpredictable) real world actions by your robot to increase its wallet balance.
