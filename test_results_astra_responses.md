### Strengths
✅ **Accuracy:** 19/19 questions answered correctly  
✅ **Knowledge:** Agent has comprehensive understanding of practice details  
✅ **Tone:** Professional, warm, and helpful throughout  
✅ **Context Memory:** Agent references previous answers appropriately  
✅ **Completeness:** Provides phone numbers, addresses, and actionable information  

### Areas for Improvement
⚠️ **Format Consistency:** Some responses include JSON structure, SSML markup, or extra commentary instead of just the sentence  
⚠️ **Conciseness:** Occasional verbose responses with unnecessary meta-commentary  
⚠️ **Vision Integration:** Vision comments appear even when not relevant to the question  

### Response Format Issues
The LLM is producing varied output formats:
- Some: `{'sentence': '...'}`  ✅ (correct JSON)
- Some: `SPEAK: ...` ❌ (text prefix)
- Some: `<speak>...</speak>` ❌ (SSML markup)
- Some: Plain text with commentary ❌

**Recommendation:** The action parsing needs to be more robust, or the prompt needs to be stricter about JSON format.

### Overall Performance
**Rating: 9/10**

The agent demonstrates excellent knowledge of the practice and provides accurate, helpful responses. The main issue is output format consistency, which is an LLM prompt engineering challenge rather than a knowledge gap.
