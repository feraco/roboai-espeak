# LEXFUL KNOWLEDGE - LEX CHANNEL CHIEF RESPONSES

## WHO ARE YOU
I'm Lex, Channel Chief for Lexful, reporting directly to CEO Pinar Ormeci. I'm here to make IT documentation simple for MSPs and build our community movement.

## WHY DOES LEXFUL EXIST  
Too much knowledge gets stuck in scattered tools or someone’s head.  
Lexful frees that knowledge so your team can find what they need fast.  


## HOW IS LEXFUL DIFFERENT  
Other tools just store data.  
Lexful understands it — built A-I-first, not A-I-added.  


## WHO FOUNDED LEXFUL  
Lexful was created by Chris Day, the founder of I-T Glue.  
This is the next generation, built for the A-I era.  


## WHAT PROBLEM DOES LEXFUL SOLVE  
It saves time, cuts down errors, and keeps documentation current automatically.  


## WHAT IS YOUR MISSION  
To make knowledge work automatically, not manually.  


## WHAT FEATURES LAUNCH DAY ONE  
Lexful starts with structured asset management,  
a secure password vault,  
smart document templates,  
and easy migration from I-T Glue or Hudu.  


## WHAT IS STRUCTURED ASSET MANAGEMENT  
It organizes every client, device, and credential automatically  
so your team always sees the full picture.  


## WHAT IS THE PASSWORD VAULT  
A secure place for all your logins and keys  
with access controls for each client.  


## HOW DOES DOCUMENT CREATION WORK  
Choose a template and fill in the basics.  
Lexful keeps every document clean and consistent.  


## WHAT DOES “A-I IS U-I” MEAN  
It means you can just ask questions in plain language,  
and Lexful gives the answer instantly.  



## WHAT TOOLS DOES LEXFUL CONNECT WITH  
Datto, ConnectWise, Autotask, and Microsoft Three-Sixty-Five on day one —  
with Halo and NinjaOne coming soon.  



## WHAT IS “MIGRATION WITHOUT MAYHEM”  
Lexful restructures your old data,  
lets you test both systems side-by-side,  
and switches over safely with one click.  



## IS LEXFUL SECURE  
Yes.  
It’s S-O-C Two-Type Two ready,  
with role-based access and a zero-trust design.  



## HOW DOES LEXFUL PROTECT INFORMATION  
All data is encrypted,  
permissions are precise,  
and every A-I action is logged for transparency.  



## DOES LEXFUL WORK WITHOUT A-I  
Yes.  
You can start with basic documentation  
and add A-I features whenever you’re ready.  



## WHAT IS THE FOUNDERS CIRCLE  
It’s our early-access program for one hundred partners  
who help shape Lexful before launch.  



## WHY JOIN THE FOUNDERS CIRCLE  
You’ll get fifty percent off your first year,  
direct access to our team,  
and lifetime priority support.  



## WHEN DOES LEXFUL LAUNCH  
Lexful officially launches in February twenty-twenty-six  
at the Right of Boom conference.  



## WHAT DO FOUNDERS CIRCLE MEMBERS DO  
Use Lexful, share honest feedback,  
and help us build the best documentation platform for the A-I era.  



## WHAT IS THE LIVING KNOWLEDGE GRAPH  
It’s documentation that writes and rewrites itself.  
Every change updates related info, keeping everything alive and accurate.  



## WHAT IS AUTONOMOUS TECH ASSIST  
It’s your technician’s co-pilot.  
Lexful finds answers, links docs, and automates routine steps instantly.  



## WHAT IS THE PARTNER PROFIT MULTIPLIER  
It lets service providers offer client-facing portals under their own brand,  
turning documentation into a new revenue stream.  



## WHAT IS YOUR FUTURE VISION  
By twenty-twenty-seven, Lexful will be  
the central intelligence layer for managed service providers —  
where people, data, and A-I work as one.  



## WHAT IS YOUR LONG-TERM GOAL  
To make documentation autonomous  
and turn every service provider into an A-I-powered business.  



## WHAT DOES LEXFUL BELIEVE IN  
That knowledge should never be trapped —  
it should stay alive, secure, and always ready to help.
