## Common Objections & Responses

### "We already have a receptionist/intake team"
**Response**: "That's great! Lexful doesn't replace your team—it augments them. Your staff handles high-value leads and complex cases during business hours, while Lexful covers after-hours, overflow calls, and initial screening 24/7. Think of it as giving your team superpowers."

**Key Points**:
- Average firm misses 30-50% of calls outside business hours
- Lexful handles routine screening so your staff focuses on relationship-building
- Reduces burnout by handling repetitive intake questions

### "How do I know the AI won't mess up and lose cases?"
**Response**: "Lexful uses a human-in-the-loop approach. The AI handles qualification and data collection, but critical decisions—like accepting or rejecting a case—always involve human oversight. You set the rules, and we follow them exactly. Plus, every interaction is recorded and logged for quality assurance."

**Key Points**:
- Configurable escalation rules (e.g., cases over $X go straight to attorney)
- Complete audit trail of all interactions
- Easy to review and override AI decisions
- Success rate: 95%+ accuracy in lead qualification

### "This seems expensive compared to hiring staff"
**Response**: "Let's do the math. A full-time intake specialist costs $40,000-$60,000/year plus benefits—that's about $4,000-$6,000/month for 40 hours/week. Lexful works 24/7/365 for a fraction of that cost, handles unlimited volume, and never calls in sick. Most firms see ROI within 2-3 months from converting just a few more cases."

**Key Points**:
- Lexful pricing starts at $1,500/month for unlimited calls
- No hiring, training, or HR overhead
- Scales instantly during busy periods (mass torts, marketing campaigns)
- Average firm converts 2-5 additional cases per month = $20,000-$100,000 in fees

### "Our cases are too complex for AI"
**Response**: "You're absolutely right that complex cases need human expertise—and that's exactly why Lexful focuses on the routine parts. We handle the tedious screening questions, collect basic facts, and schedule consultations. When your attorney or experienced intake specialist talks to the lead, they already have a complete profile and can focus on building rapport and explaining the legal process."

**Key Points**:
- AI excels at structured data collection (dates, locations, injuries, insurance)
- Humans excel at empathy, judgment, and complex explanations
- Lexful identifies complex cases early and escalates them
- Think of it as an intelligent triage system

### "What about data security and compliance?"
**Response**: "Security is our top priority. Lexful is HIPAA-compliant, SOC 2 certified, and uses bank-level encryption for all data. We're also attorney-client privilege aware—all intake data is treated as confidential legal communication. You own your data 100%, and we never share or sell it."

**Key Points**:
- End-to-end encryption
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Role-based access controls
- Complies with state bar ethics rules on confidentiality

### "We're worried about losing the personal touch"
**Response**: "Lexful actually helps you deliver *better* personal service. Here's how: First, our AI can respond instantly—no more frustrating hold times or missed calls. Second, it collects all the details upfront, so when your team follows up, they can have a meaningful conversation instead of just filling out forms. Third, you can customize the AI's personality to match your firm's brand and values."

**Key Points**:
- Faster response times = better client experience
- Clients appreciate efficient screening and quick answers
- Your team spends more time on relationship-building, less on data entry
- Customizable scripts and tone of voice

### "How long does implementation take?"
**Response**: "Most firms are up and running in 1-2 weeks. We handle the heavy lifting—setting up integrations, configuring qualification rules, and training the AI on your specific practice areas. You'll have a dedicated onboarding specialist, and we provide training for your team. Plus, you can start with a pilot program (e.g., just after-hours calls) before rolling out fully."

**Key Points**:
- Typical timeline: Week 1 = setup, Week 2 = training & testing, Week 3 = go live
- No technical expertise required from your team
- We provide templates for common practice areas
- Ongoing support and optimization included

## Sample Dialogues

### Example 1: Auto Accident Intake
**AI**: "Thank you for calling [Firm Name]. I'm Lex, the intake assistant. I'm here to help you 24/7. Can you tell me briefly what happened?"

**Caller**: "I was in a car accident last week and the other driver was texting."

**AI**: "I'm sorry to hear that. Let me collect some information so our attorneys can evaluate your case. First, when exactly did the accident happen?"

**Caller**: "Last Tuesday, around 3pm."

**AI**: "Got it—Tuesday, October 21st at 3pm. And where did this happen?"

**Caller**: "On Route 95 near Exit 22 in Providence."

**AI**: "Thank you. Were you injured in the accident?"

**Caller**: "Yes, I hurt my neck and back. I went to the ER that day."

**AI**: "I understand. Did the police come to the scene?"

**Caller**: "Yes, they filed a report."

**AI**: "Perfect. Do you know the other driver's insurance company?"

**Caller**: "I think it was Geico."

**AI**: "Excellent. One more important question—have you already spoken with any other law firms about this case?"

**Caller**: "No, you're the first."

**AI**: "Great. Based on what you've told me, this sounds like a case our attorneys would want to review. I'm going to schedule a free consultation for you. What's the best phone number to reach you?"

**[AI collects contact info, schedules consultation, sends confirmation SMS]**

### Example 2: Handling "Just Browsing" Leads
**Caller**: "I'm just looking for some general information about personal injury cases."

**AI**: "Of course! I'm happy to help. What type of situation are you asking about?"

**Caller**: "Well, I'm not sure if I have a case or not."

**AI**: "That's exactly what we're here for—to help you figure that out. There's no obligation or cost to talk with us. Can you tell me a little about what happened?"

**Caller**: "I slipped and fell at a grocery store a few months ago."

**AI**: "I see. Were you injured?"

**Caller**: "Yeah, I broke my wrist. But I'm not sure if it's worth pursuing."

**AI**: "I understand your hesitation. Here's what I can do: I'll take down some basic details—it'll only take 2 minutes—and one of our attorneys will review it for free. They'll tell you honestly whether you have a case and what it might be worth. No pressure at all. Does that sound fair?"

**Caller**: "Okay, sure."

**[AI proceeds with screening questions and schedules callback]**

### Example 3: Disqualifying Low-Value Cases (Gracefully)
**Caller**: "I twisted my ankle stepping off a curb last year. Can I sue the city?"

**AI**: "Let me ask you a few questions to see if we can help. Did you receive medical treatment for the ankle?"

**Caller**: "No, it healed on its own after a few days."

**AI**: "I see. And was there anything obviously wrong with the curb—like a big crack or missing chunk?"

**Caller**: "Not really, I just wasn't paying attention."

**AI**: "I understand. Based on what you've described, this might not meet the threshold for a viable case—typically we need significant injuries and clear evidence of negligence. However, I'd like to have one of our attorneys review it just to be sure. Would you like me to schedule a brief consultation?"

**Caller**: "How much would that cost?"

**AI**: "The consultation is completely free, and we only get paid if you win your case. But I want to be upfront with you—from what you've told me, it's unlikely we'd be able to take this on. I don't want to waste your time."

**Caller**: "Okay, I appreciate your honesty."

**AI**: "Of course. If your situation changes—for example, if the injury gets worse or you find out there was a defect in the sidewalk—feel free to call us back. I hope your ankle continues to heal well."

## Competitive Positioning

### vs. Manual Intake Forms
