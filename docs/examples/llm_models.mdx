## Emotion Detection with DeepSeek, Gemini, or Grok

These examples are similar to the `Hello World (Spot)` example, except they use `DeepSeek`, `Gemini` or `Grok` rather than `OpenAI 4o`.

The examples perform emotion detection, interact with you with voice, and provide debug information to a simulator. The code may request access to your camera, this is what it uses to capture your emotions.

```bash
uv run src/run.py deepseek
```

A web-based simulation environment (WebSim) can be accessed at http://localhost:8000.

Gemini (or Grok) can be used by running:

```bash
uv run src/run.py gemini
# Or, 
uv run src/run.py grok
```
